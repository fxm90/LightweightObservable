  s.description      = <<-DESC
Lightweight Obserservable is a simple implementation of an observable sequence that you can subscribe to.
The framework is designed to be minimal meanwhile convenient. The entire code is only ~90 lines (excluding comments).
With Lightweight Observable you can easily set up UI-Bindings in an MVVM application, handle asynchronous network calls and a lot more.
